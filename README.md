### üîç What Are AWS Core Services?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) delivers a comprehensive suite of cloud computing services that allow organizations to build and manage applications in a flexible and cost-effective environment. This resource focuses on the core AWS services categorized into the following areas:

| Category               | Key Services                     | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Compute**            | EC2, Lambda, ELB                 | Hosts applications, enables serverless workloads, and distributes traffic. |
| **Storage**            | S3, EBS                          | Provides durable, scalable storage for static assets and application data. |
| **Database**           | RDS, DynamoDB                    | Offers managed SQL and NoSQL databases for scalable data access.       |
| **Networking**         | VPC, Route 53, CloudFront        | Delivers networking, routing, and content delivery capabilities.        |
| **Security & Identity**| IAM, Security Groups             | Manages user access, authentication, and traffic control.               |
| **Monitoring**         | CloudWatch                       | Enables observability through logs, metrics, and alarms.                |
| **Messaging & Email**  | SNS, SES                         | Supports application communication and transactional email delivery.   |
| **AI/ML**              | Amazon Bedrock                   | Provides access to foundational models for generative AI applications. |
| **Serverless & OSS**   | Lambda, Open Source Integrations | Facilitates event-driven architectures using open technologies.         |
